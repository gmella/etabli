try {
    yourDataModelObject = (YourDataModelClass) JAXBUtils.loadObject(fileURL, jaxbFactory);
} catch (IOException ioe) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Load failure on " + fileURL, ioe);
}

// TODO : manipulate your data model here...

JAXBUtils.saveObject(stringWriter, yourDataModelObject, jaxbFactory);
```
